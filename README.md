# Evaluation-of-proxies-of-latent-variables
Inspired by Bai and Ng (2005), Evaluating Latent and Observed Factors in Macroeconomics and Finance. The purpose is to understand and implement their methodology for assessing observable variables as proxies for latent factors. These experiments supported a completed research article applying these techniques to equity and cryptocurrency markets.
